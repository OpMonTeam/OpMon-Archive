## How do I contribute code?
OpMon Lazuli uses the ["Fork & Pull"](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests#fork--pull)
method for code contributions. Start by cloning the repository locally as your development copy and make changes to your local branch as you develop. Once you have
decided that you have sufficient changes in your branch that you'd like to merge back to the master, submit a pull request.

## Making a Pull Request
**When your changes are done, you can create a pull request. If you have created a new branch in your fork, submit your modifications to the base branch of yours. If you have directly modified the branch, submit your modifications directly in the corresponding branch of the repository.**
